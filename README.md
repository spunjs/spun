> Rapid Selenium Spec Authoring

`spun` is a command line tool that compiles `spun` files down to selenium code.  The
output may be anything from `node` to `java` to `ruby`.  The idea is that you can
author a language agnostic selenium specification and run it on any platform.

`spun` relies on `strategy providers` to convert a spun file down to a languge.
`spun` will search `package.json` for the first dependency prefixed with
`spun-`.  Because a `strategy provider` is likely to include [spun-util](https://github.com/spunjs/spun-util.git),
`spun-util` is ignored in this search.

`spun` also assumes that by default your language compiles down to `node`.  By default
`spun` will attempt to run the results using `node`.  You an override this behavior
using [the options](#options).

## Why the name?
A google search for `spun definition` resulted in this:

Webster:
```
  past or present of spin.
```

Not very cool.

Urban:
```
  1. A state of mind that exists because of using an amphetamine for a prolonged amount of time through repeated ingestion.
  2. To be under the influence of almost any stimulant, such as meth, straight speed...

  Usage: "Man I'm spun out on crack..."
```

Not very cool either.

A goole search for `selenium definition` resulted in this:
```
  the chemical element of atomic number 34, a gray crystalline nonmetal with semiconducting properties.
```

Hmm, a chemical element.  Yeureeka!  `spun` let's you get `spun` out on `selenium`!

Still not very cool ;)
